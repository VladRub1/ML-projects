# Unsupervised

[Here](./unsupervised-project-Rubanov.ipynb), you can find the implementation and 
comparison of the following **unsupervised learning methods**:
* **Clustering** (on _geographical and textual data_):
  * Spectral (custom implementation)
  * K-Means
  * DBSCAN
* **Text Topic Modeling:**:
  * K-Means on tf-idf
  * Latent Dirichlet Allocation (_LDA_)

The work also includes the application of **semi-supervised methods** in machine learning:
* Label Propagation algorithm (_LPA_)
* Label Spreading algorithm (_LSA_)

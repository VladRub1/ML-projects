# Bias-Variance Decomposition

This project implements a comparison and analysis of various machine learning 
algorithms from the perspective of **decomposing error into bias and variance** 
(_Bias-Variance Decomposition_).

Specifically, it examines:
* _Linear Regression_
* _Decision Tree (single)_
* _Random Forest_
* _Gradient Boosting_

The project also includes **visualization** of the algorithms' performance.

This section contains **original machine learning projects** that do not fit 
into a separate classic category:
* **[Bias-Variance Decomposition](./Bias-Variance%20Decomposition)**: a project 
on the practical implementation of the theoretical concept of _decomposing error 
into bias and variance_ (**Bias-Variance Decomposition**). 
It includes a **comparison of different machine learning algorithms** from 
the perspective of this concept.

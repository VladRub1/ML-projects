# Linear Classification

This project involves a comparison and analysis of classic methods 
of **linear classification**:
  * Logistic Regression (_LR_)
  * Support Vector Machines (_SVM_)

across various parameters. Also implemented are:
* _probability calibration_ for linear classifiers
* different methods for _processing categorical data_
* _feature selection_ in the model
* _assessment of the economic impact of the model_ depending on various hyperparameters

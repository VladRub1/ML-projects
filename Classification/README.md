# Classification

This section presents projects addressing **classification** tasks:

* **[Kernel Methods](./Kernel%20Methods)**: implementation of _kernel methods in 
machine learning_ for classification using Support Vector Machines (_SVM_)
* **[Linear Classification](./Linear%20Classification)**: comparison and analysis of 
classic methods of linear classification in machine learning:
  * Logistic Regression (_LR_)
  * Support Vector Machines (_SVM_)
* **[Metric Learning](./Metric%20Learning)**: training custom metrics based on 
_Mahalanobis distance_ for metric methods of classification in tasks with 
_limited datasets_ (determining the author of a painting).

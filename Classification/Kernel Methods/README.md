# Kernel Methods

This section presents an example of implementing **kernel methods in machine learning**, 
demonstrated through a classification task using the **Fashion MNIST dataset** (10 classes).

The project features the development and application of an SVM algorithm with 
**kernel trick** (using _kernel approximation_ through the method of 
RFF â€” _Random Fourier Features_).

The work also includes a _comparison_ of different classification algorithms:
* Kernel and Linear SVM
* Logistic Regression
* Gradient Boosting with **[CatBoost](https://catboost.ai/)** implementation

Examples are provided showing all algorithms operating with and without 
**dimensionality reduction**.

# Linear Regression

This section features various **custom** implementations of **linear regressions**:
* **[Gradient Descent](./Gradient%20Descent)**: presents a _custom implementation of linear
regression_, as well as _various gradient descent algorithms_ and their comparisons:
  * using different loss functions
  * with and without regularization
* **[New York City Taxi Trip Duration](./New%20York%20City%20Taxi%20Trip%20Duration)**:
implements
  * exploratory data analysis (_EDA_)
  * works with _cartographic data_ (including interactive visualization using 
  the `folium` library), 
  * _anomaly detection_ in data
  * applying linear regression for _predicting taxi trip durations_ in New York City
